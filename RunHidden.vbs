' RunHidden.vbs -- starts the watcher with no console window at all.
'
' Running powershell.exe directly from Task Scheduler creates a console window
' every time the task fires. "-WindowStyle Hidden" does not prevent it: that
' switch applies to the PowerShell host window after startup, while the console
' itself is allocated before the script runs, so it flashes on screen. The task's
' own "Hidden" setting is unrelated -- it hides the task in the Task Scheduler
' library, not the window.
'
' WScript.Shell.Run with window style 0 launches the process with no window from
' the outset. wscript.exe exits immediately, so the watcher outlives it and the
' scheduled task shows as finished; duplicate starts are prevented by the mutex
' inside SLCWatcher.ps1 rather than by the task's MultipleInstances policy.
'
' Any arguments given here are passed through to the script.
