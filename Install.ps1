.SYNOPSIS
    Installs ArchonLauncher as a hidden logon scheduled task for the current user.

.DESCRIPTION
    Copies the watcher into %LOCALAPPDATA%\ArchonLauncher, registers a scheduled
    task that starts it at logon, and starts it immediately.

    No administrator rights are required -- the task runs as the current user
    only. Re-running this script safely overwrites a previous install.

.PARAMETER TaskName
    Scheduled task name. Default "ArchonLauncher".

.PARAMETER QuitWithWow
    Also close the apps when WoW exits.

.PARAMETER NoWowUp
    Never start WowUp, even when it is installed.

.PARAMETER NoCurseForge
    Never start CurseForge, even when it is installed.

.PARAMETER HeartbeatMinutes
    How often Task Scheduler re-checks that the watcher is alive, restarting it
    if it isn't. Default 5.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Install.ps1 -NoCurseForge

# Task Scheduler's "restart on failure" only covers a task that fails to START,
# not one whose process is killed later. Without a heartbeat, anything that
# terminates the watcher (a manual kill, a reinstall, an overzealous security
# tool) leaves it dead until the next logon -- silently.
#
# Attaching repetition to the logon trigger does NOT work: it only repeats
# within that trigger's own window and will not revive a task mid-session.
# An independent Once trigger with its own repetition does. MultipleInstances
# is IgnoreNew, so a heartbeat that fires while the watcher is healthy is a
