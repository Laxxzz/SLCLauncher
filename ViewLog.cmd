rem Version is read out of the installed script so it always reflects what is
rem actually running, not what happens to be sitting in this folder.

rem The pattern below deliberately avoids a negated class like [^']. cmd treats
rem ^ as its escape character and strips it even inside quotes, so [^'] arrives
rem at PowerShell as ['] -- an inverted match that silently finds nothing. The
rem non-greedy (.+?) needs no caret and behaves identically here.

rem The ProcessId test is not paranoia: without it this check always reports a
rem running watcher, even with nothing installed at all. This very command line
rem contains the text *ArchonLauncher.ps1* as its own search pattern, so the
rem query matches the process running the query. Install.ps1 and Uninstall.ps1
rem exclude $PID for the same reason.
